You are organizing an event, and the ticket pricing depends on the number of `tickets purchased`. Write a JavaScript function named `calculateTotalCost` that takes the number of tickets as input and calculates the `total cost` based on the following pricing rules:

1.  If the number of tickets is `less than 100`, the price per ticket is `100 taka`.
2.  If the number of tickets is `more than 100 but less than 200`, the `first 100 tickets are 100 taka` each, and `the rest are 90 taka `each.
3.  if you purchase more than 200 tickets

           first 100 ---> 100tk
           101-200 ---> 90tk
           200+ ----> 70tk
